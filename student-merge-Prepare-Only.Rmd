This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Prepare Step}
summary(sPerformanceMerged)

summary(sPerformanceMerged$G1.x)
summary(sPerformanceMerged$G1.y)
summary(sPerformanceMerged$G2.x)
summary(sPerformanceMerged$G2.y)
summary(sPerformanceMerged$G3.x)
summary(sPerformanceMerged$age)

```
